# Prevention-of-Economic-Fraud-using-NFC-and-NIDS
Final year project at MSRIT, ISE. To prevent economic fraud using a 3 layer NFC security system and a Machine learning based Network Intrusion Detection System.

## NFC Card Technology
Technology called NFC to enforce security during transaction and usage. This paper’s methodology aims at using both NFC-enabled and non-enabled cell phones for designing a dedicated application that can communicate with the ATM machine.
Due to inherently short-range capabilities of NFC, cell phones can communicate with ATM machines only within close proximity. 
Our proposed system eliminates the requirement of a password or a PIN, which is entirely pivotal to keeping to memory or safe storage of an authentication key.
Since conventional card blocking processes tend to be cumbersome and time consuming, our system was designed both to overcome afore mentioned security issues and to additionally eliminate common inconveniences by facilitating blocking of cards from ATMs nearest to the user.<br><br>
 
●	Secured ATM transactions using NFC<br>
●	Blocking of lost ATM cards<br>
●	NFC registration<br>
●	Facilitation of NFC using non-NFC mobile phones<br><br>

The files for this part of the project are 'android'-App, 'db' - SQL databases and 'java'- App related functionalities using NFC.<br>

## Network Intrusion Detection System

Our proposed system enhances the security protocol for transfer of transaction/ payment through the network during either one of the credit card payment cycles.
The NIDS uses the KNN Classification custom algorithm to find the nearest neighbour for detection of the network based attacks in the UNSW-NB15 dataset.<br>
Following are the advantages of using NIDS as an extra layer for detection:<br><br>
●	Secure Transactions at a protocol level<br>
●	It can Qualify and Quantify attacks<br>
●	Prevent loss of sensitive information<br>
●	It can boost efficiency<br><br>

The files for this part of the project are 'KNN_Detection_Start.py' & 'Decision_tree_binary' -NIDS algorithm, 'UNSW_NB15_test-set' & 'UNSW_NB15_training-set' - Test and train datasets and remaining files are related to description of the dataset.<br><br>
